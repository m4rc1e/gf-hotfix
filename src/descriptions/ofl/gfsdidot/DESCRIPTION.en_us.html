The famous French typecutter Firmin Didot designed a new Greek typeface in Paris in 1805, under the influence of the neoclassical ideals of the late 18th century. 
It was immediately used in the publishing programme of Adamantios Korai, the prominent intellectual figure of the Greek diaspora and leading scholar of the Greek Enligntment. 
Didot’s grandson Ambroise Firmin Didot eventually brought the typeface to Greece with a field press during the Greek Revolution in 1821. 
Since then the typeface has enjoyed an unrivaled success as the preferred choice of almost every kind of publication until the last decades of the 20th century. 
Didot’s type was the base for a new font, GFS Didot (1994) which was designed by Takis Katsoulidis, and digitized by George Matthiopoulos.
