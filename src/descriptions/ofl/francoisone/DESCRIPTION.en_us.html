Francois One is a reworking of many traditional sans serif gothic display typeface forms. 
These letterforms have been reshaped for use on the web, such as opening up the counters a little and optimizing the stems for use in bold display typography. 
Slanted stem terminals have been added to give a hint of playfulness to the design.
