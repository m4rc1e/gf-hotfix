Fjord One is a serif typeface designed with printed books in mind, and particularly intended for long texts in small print sizes.  
It features sturdy construction, prominent serifs, low-contrast modulation and long elegant ascenders and descenders relative to the x height. 
Fjord performs well at text sizes and because of the careful detailing it can also be a distinctive choice for headlines and in corporate design. 
It is inspired by both renaissance and contemporary typeface designs.
