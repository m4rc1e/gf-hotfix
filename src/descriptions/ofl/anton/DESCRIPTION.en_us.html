Anton is a reworking of many traditional advertising sans serif typefaces. 
The letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers.

Anton was extended from a single bold style into a family in March 2013, named <a href="http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antonio">Antonio</a>
