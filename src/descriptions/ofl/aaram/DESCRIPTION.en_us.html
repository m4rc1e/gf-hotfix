Aaram is a unique typeface with pizzazz supporting Tamil and Latin. 
Primarily designed for screen usage, it also works awesome in print media too.
The shapes of this font are derived from the different radius of a circle and possible curves in a rectangle. 
This led to the name Aaram, a Tamil language word that litereally means radius.

The Aaram project is led by Tharique Azeez, a type designer based in Sri Lanka.
