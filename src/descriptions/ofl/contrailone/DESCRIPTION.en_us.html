Contrail One is based on handmade sans-serif letters seen on UK posters. 
The slight slant and bouncy quality suggest the emerging jet age, and a state of excited anticipation. 
The rounded corners give it an approachable friendly feeling. 
As a low contrast design it is suitable for use in medium to large sizes, including headlines. 
This font was made specifically to be used as web type.
