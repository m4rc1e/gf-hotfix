Seymour One is derived from the earlier webfont 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Sigmar+One">Sigmar One</a>,
but the forms have also been influenced by late nineteenth and early twentieth
century British sans-serif typefaces. The result is a display face that is
ideal for bold, unpretentious, and slightly playful display typography.
Seymour One is designed to be used conventionally but also as an 'all caps'
font.
