Benne is a Kannada text font developed by John Harrington. 
It integrates the Latin font EB Garamond, originally developed by by Georg Duffner.

The Benne project aims simply to create an improved reading experience for Kannada text. 
Considering how often we read on screen, and how every day tasks are becoming more and more prevalent, there is a lack of high quality fonts for South Indian scripts that have high readability on screen.

The Benne project is led by PostStudio, a type design foundry based in London, UK.
