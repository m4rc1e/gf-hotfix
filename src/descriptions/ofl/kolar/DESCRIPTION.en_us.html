Kolar is a multi-script Open Source family of typefaces intended to support texts in Kannada or a language that uses the Latin script. 
It is ideal for long texts that involve immersive reading.
Five fonts are available: Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold. 
Each font’s character set includes 925 glyphs. 
This massive range supports hundreds of unique Kannada-script conjuncts.

Kolar’s Latin-script characters are all modified from Pablo Impallari’s Libre Baskerville series. 
Those fonts were optimised for 16px-high web body text; Kolar’s Kannada characters follow their lead. 
Libre Baskerville is an excellent match for the Kannada script, because – like John Baskerville’s 18th century type – typographically-formed letters for Kannada text are almost always drawn with a high amount of vertical contrast. 
The horizontal elements along the bottoms of the letters in Kolar are very heavy, as may be expected.

Ramakrishna Saiteja designed Kolar’s Kannada character set for Indian Type Foundry.
