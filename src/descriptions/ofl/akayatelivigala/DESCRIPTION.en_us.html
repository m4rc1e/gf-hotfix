Akaya Telivigala supports the reformed Telugu character set, and the language support therefore extends to contemporary Telugu and basic Sanskrit.
When one looks around the hand-written Telugu or Kannada landscape today, a recurring calligraphic style can be found on book titles, graffiti or propaganda notices. 
Akaya is based on this lively hand-written style that is distinct from the rigid, formal text styles.

The Telugu component was designed first by Vaishnavi Murthy, a type designer based in India. 
The Latin component was designed in a second stage to be in harmony with the Indian design, by Juan Luis Blanco.
