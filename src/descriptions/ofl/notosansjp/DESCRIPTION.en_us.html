<p>Note: Noto Sans JP has been subsetted to 6,992 characters and contains most of the characters defined by <a href="//www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/JIS/JIS0208.TXT">JIS X 0208</a> and some additional characters from
Shift_JIS. The set includes 6,390 Kanji as well as 602 non Kanji characters such as Hiragana, Katakana (including half-width variants), ASCII and full-width and punctuations.</p>

<p>Note: Due to browser's poor handling of non X00 weights, the DemiLight weight of Noto Sans JP has been removed.</p>
