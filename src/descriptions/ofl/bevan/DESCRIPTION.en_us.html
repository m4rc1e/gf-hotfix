Bevan is a reworking of a traditional slab serif display typeface created by Heinrich Jost in the 1930s. 
In Bevan, Jost's earlier letterforms have been digitized and then reshaped for use on the web, such as opening up the counterforms a little and optimizing the stems for use in bold display typography in modern web browsers.
