Varela Round is based on the well known font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela">Varela</a>. 
The rounded corners make it perfect for a soft feel and work great at any size. 
It is suitable for headlines and printed collateral, and maintains its distinct properties amongst other objects. 
Varela Round is a great font for any website.
