Neythal is a Latin and Tamil handwriting font that adds the feeling of authentic handwriting to your texts. 
It can used to make contemporary designs, and it fits everywhere as it is graciously thin.
Fun fact about the name of the font: 
Neythal is a Tamil language word for &#8220;seashore&#8221; and &#8220;adjoining lands.&#8221;
The designer, Tharique Azeez, loves places with lovely seashores.
