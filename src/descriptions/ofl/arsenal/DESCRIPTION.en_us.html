Arsenal is a semi-grotesque with traditional forms. 
It is primarily designed for body text and intended for professional visual communication. 
The special qualities of these letter shapes, such as subtle contrast modulation, articulate grace and expressivity. 
Arsenal's somewhat lyrical sentiment abides to the Ukrainian nature of the font. 
The main design features are the narrow proportions, that allow for economical typesetting, the moderate aperture and the observable contrast. 
These create some notable traits: Neutrality, clarity, and swiftness.
