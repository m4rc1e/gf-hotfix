Langar has informal, playful letterforms and supports the Gurmukhi and Latin writing systems. 
It broadly follows the ‘upright italic’ Latin style, and introduces a new experimental style to the Gurmukhi script. 
This harmonized Latin-Gurmukhi design aims to expand the possibilities for everyone working with bilingual texts. 
It works best in larger sizes, providing a contrasting secondary style to a more traditional ‘text typeface’ style.
