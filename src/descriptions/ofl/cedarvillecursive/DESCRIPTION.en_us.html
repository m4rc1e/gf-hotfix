Cederville Cursive is based on the handwriting of a cheerful young preschool teacher. 
From her love of her Cedarville University alma mater to her passion for her students, she is a delightful, dependable person. 
Her handwriting contains that same blend of fun appeal with restrained discipline. 
Many handwritten script fonts have large flourishes, but this is a more simple script, similar to authentic daily handwriting.
