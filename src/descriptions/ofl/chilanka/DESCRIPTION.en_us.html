Chilanka is Malayalam and Latin handwriting style font designed by Santhosh Thottingal. 
The Malayalam design follows the common style one can see in everyday handwriting.
It has a comprehensive Malayalam glyph set that contains most of the unique Malayalam conjuncts.

The glyph strokes are of uniform width with round ends giving the impression of being written with either a thin felt-tip pen, or a ball-point pen. 
Sharp corners are completely avoided to express the fine touch of the beautiful curves of the Malayalam script. 
The handwriting style is not that of a calligrapher, but is based on many handwriting samples that Santhosh observed. 
Even though the design is handwriting, each glyph respects the horizontal baseline and so this typeface can be used for body text too.

The font was initially released in 2014 and nowadays used widely in comic strips, invitation letters, and other informal Malayalam typography - it is one of the popular fonts released by Swathanthra Malayam Computing.
The Latin design was added to match the Malayalam in 2015. 
Chilanka is developed using Inkscape and Fontforge.

The Chilanka project is led by SMC (Swathanthra Malayalam Computing), a Free Software developer community based in Kerala, India.
