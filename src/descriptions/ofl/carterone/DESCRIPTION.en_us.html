Carter is a reworking of particular casual typeforms that were popular around the mid 20th century, often found used in advertising or pulp fiction book covers. 
The letterforms have been reshaped and digitized for use on the web, such as opening up the counterforms a little and optimizing the stems for use in display typography.
